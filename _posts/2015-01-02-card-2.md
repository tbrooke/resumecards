That delightful bunch from Beryl's Cove, NC is back, this time, Suzanne's college reunion is coming up, and it promises to be exciting. A train excursion from the coast all the way through the Midwest and to Chicago. Instead of sightseeing and revelry, the alumni are confronted with murder, most foul, as Steve Thomas, with an able assist from his gorgeous wife, try to solve the case and clear up the mystery. After meeting with an old law enforcement ally, they unravel a tangled web of deceit and intrigue that only gets more complicated, the deeper they dig.
